<p><strong>The call has ended: it is no longer possible to submit abstracts.</strong></p>

<p>Different theories and models attribute linguistic variation and change to different causes. Currently, significant tension exists between approaches that explain variation and change in terms of a parametric approach to the structure of grammar and the language learner&rsquo;s interaction with primary linguistic data, and approaches that instead derive variation and change from usage effects and the social embedding of language. The two-day long symposium is devoted to addressing this tension in an effort to arrive at a better understanding of the status quo of research on language variation and change, and to outline the most fruitful ways forward towards formal models that make quantitative, empirically testable predictions.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-submission">Abstract submission</h2>

<p>Abstracts are invited for both oral (20 minutes, plus 10 minutes for discussion) and poster presentations. Questions to be addressed may include, but are not limited to:</p>

<div class="questions questions-cfp">
<span class="q">What role do abstract representations play in language change?</span>
<span class="q">How do acquisition and usage interact to produce patterns of variation and change?
</span>
<span class="q">How can acquisition and usage effects be detected in diachronic data?
</span>
<span class="q">What role do frequency effects play in language change?
</span>
<span class="q">What is the basic replicator in the cultural evolution of language?
</span>
<span class="q">How can social network theory inform models of linguistic variation and change?
</span>
<span class="q">What is the effect of individual lifespan change on variation and change on the level of the speech community?
</span>
<span class="q">How can current mathematical and computational models of variation and change be scaled up towards more linguistic and sociological realism?
</span>
<span class="q">Is a unified approach to language change, incorporating both a theory of representations and a theory of usage, necessary to fully explain variation and change?
</span>
<span class="q">Is such an approach possible, in principle?
</span>
</div>

<p>Both theoretical/computational and empirical contributions are welcome, as is work in progress. Abstracts must be anonymous, in PDF format and a maximum of 2 A4 pages in length (1 page text, 1 page figures, examples and references). Submissions are peer-reviewed (double blind) by an international panel of experts.</p>

<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through">Deadline for submissions: <strong>22 April 2019</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through">Extended deadline for submissions: <strong>10 May 2019</strong> (abstracts that have already been submitted may be edited until the extended deadline)</span></li>
