      <description>Different theories and models attribute linguistic variation and change to different causes. Currently, significant tension exists between approaches that explain variation and change in terms of a parametric approach to the structure of grammar and the language learner&amp;rsquo;s interaction with primary linguistic data, and approaches that instead derive variation and change from usage effects and the social embedding of language. The two-day long symposium is devoted to addressing this tension in an effort to arrive at a better understanding of the status quo of research on language variation and change, and to outline the most fruitful ways forward towards formal models that make quantitative, empirically testable predictions.</description>
