Richard A. Blythe, University of Edinburgh Competition between linguistic variants at the individual and population scale
A number of documented language changes (e.g., names for an object, or alternative grammatical structures) can be couched as a competition between an existing ‘conventional’ variant and one or more incoming ‘innovations’. Mathematical models allow one to determine how processes acting at the individual speaker level (such as matching the frequencies of existing variants, cognitive biases that favour specific innovations or sociolinguistic prestige effects) manifest themselves at the population scale, with social network structures mediating between them.</description>

      <title>Call for Papers</title>

      <description>The call has ended: it is no longer possible to submit abstracts.
Different theories and models attribute linguistic variation and change to different causes. Currently, significant tension exists between approaches that explain variation and change in terms of a parametric approach to the structure of grammar and the language learner&amp;rsquo;s interaction with primary linguistic data, and approaches that instead derive variation and change from usage effects and the social embedding of language.</description>
